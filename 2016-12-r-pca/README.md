# cincyfp_presentation_R_2016_12

(Copy of https://github.com/Hodapp87/cincyfp_presentation_R_2016_12)

This contains material from a presentation for a talk on R that I
delivered
to
[CincyFP](https://cincyfp.wordpress.com/2016/11/29/december-meeting-5/) on
December 13, 2016.  Both are in the form
of [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks.

Presentation slides are in `CincyFP_R_slides.ipynb`, with the rendered
HTML in `CincyFP_R_demo.slides.html`.  The script `slides.sh` will
regenerate this HTML.  I'm not sure of a way to view this HTML
directly from GitHub; it may just have to be checked out and viewed
locally from the browser (GitHub will, however, render the `.ipynb`
file just fine in-browser, just not as slides).  Note that as it's
using [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/), pressing the `s`
key will create a second window showing notes, next slide, timer, and
clock.

Code written live during the talk is in `Live_demo.ipynb`.
